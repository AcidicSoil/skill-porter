# Skill Porter TUI - Interactive Conversion Tool

This document details the **Skill Porter TUI**, a new interactive terminal user interface built to streamline the process of discovering and converting AI agent skills between Claude Code and Gemini CLI formats.

## 🚀 Overview

The Skill Porter TUI wraps the core `skill-porter` CLI functionality in a visual, interactive dashboard. Instead of running individual commands for each skill, you can now:

1.  **Discover** all skills in a directory tree automatically.
2.  **Visualize** their current platform (Claude, Gemini, or Universal) and conversion status.
3.  **Convert** skills individually or in bulk with a single keystroke.
4.  **Monitor** the conversion process with real-time feedback.

Built with **Go** and **Bubble Tea**, it offers a robust and responsive user experience.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Go 1.23+**: Required to build the tool.
- **Node.js**: The underlying `skill-porter` CLI must be installed and available in your PATH.
  ```bash
  npm install -g skill-porter
  ```

### Building the Tool
Clone the repository and build the binary:

```bash
# Navigate to the project root
cd skill-porter

# Download Go dependencies
go mod tidy

# Build the binary
go build -o skill-porter-tui ./cmd/skill-porter-tui
```

You can now move `skill-porter-tui` to your PATH or run it locally.

## 🎮 Usage Guide

Start the application by running the binary. By default, it scans the current directory.

```bash
./skill-porter-tui
```

### Command Line Flags

Customize the startup behavior with these flags:

| Flag | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--root` | **Path**. The root directory to scan for skills. Defaults to current working directory. | `./skill-porter-tui --root ~/my-projects` |
| `--recursive` | **Boolean**. Whether to scan directories recursively. Default: `true`. | `./skill-porter-tui --recursive=false` |
| `--target` | **String**. Default target platform (`gemini`, `claude`, `auto`). `auto` flips the current platform. | `./skill-porter-tui --target gemini` |
| `--out` | **Path**. Base directory for conversion output. If omitted, converts in-place (or creates sibling dirs). | `./skill-porter-tui --out ./converted_skills` |
| `--auto` | **Boolean**. "Auto-Pilot" mode. Immediately starts converting all pending skills on launch. | `./skill-porter-tui --auto` |
| `--debug` | **Boolean**. Enables verbose logging to `debug.log` in the current directory. | `./skill-porter-tui --debug` |

### Interactive Keybindings

Once the TUI is running, use the following keys to navigate and control the tool:

#### Navigation
- **`↑`** or **`k`**: Move selection cursor up.
- **`↓`** or **`j`**: Move selection cursor down.

#### Actions
- **`c`**: **Convert**. Triggers conversion for the selected skill using the default or auto-determined target.
- **`g`**: **Force Gemini**. Explicitly converts the selected skill to a Gemini Extension.
- **`a`**: **Force Claude**. Explicitly converts the selected skill to a Claude Skill.
- **`A`**: **Convert All**. Triggers a batch job to convert *all* pending skills in the list.
- **`r`**: **Rescan**. Clears the list and re-scans the directory tree. Useful if you've added files externally.

#### System
- **`q`** or **`ctrl+c`**: Quit the application.

## 🖥️ Interface Guide

The screen is divided into three sections:

### 1. Skill List (Left Pane)
Displays the directory of discovered skills.
- **Name**: The folder name of the skill.
- **Platform**: Detected type (`Claude`, `Gemini`, or `Universal`).
- **Status Tag**:
  - `[Pending]`: Ready to process (Grey).
  - `[Running]`: Conversion in progress (Orange).
  - `[Success]`: Completed successfully (Green).
  - `[Failed]`: Error occurred (Red).

### 2. Details Panel (Right Pane)
Shows specific information for the **currently selected** skill.
- **Paths**: Source path and output destination.
- **Logs**: If a conversion succeeds, it shows the CLI output. If it fails, it displays the error log for debugging.

### 3. Footer (Bottom)
- **Stats**: Real-time counters for Total, Success, Failed, and Pending tasks.
- **Help**: Quick reference for keybindings.

## 🔧 Architecture & Troubleshooting

### Architecture
The tool follows the **Model-View-Update (ELM)** architecture via the Bubble Tea framework:
- **Discovery**: Runs on a separate thread to prevent UI freezing during file scans.
- **Conversion**: Spawns asynchronous `os/exec` processes to run the Node.js `skill-porter` CLI.
- **Messaging**: Updates are sent back to the UI loop via `tea.Msg` to refresh status and logs.

### Debugging
If the tool behaves unexpectedly (e.g., hangs or fails to find skills):
1. Run with debug mode: `./skill-porter-tui --debug`
2. Check the `debug.log` file created in the working directory.
3. Ensure the underlying `skill-porter` command works manually in your terminal.
