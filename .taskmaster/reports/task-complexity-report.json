			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Repository Structure, Domain Types, and Logging",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed. Focus on clean package separation.",
			"reasoning": "Standard boilerplate setup. The task is foundational but technically simple. Requires defining basic structs and setting up a logger instance."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Configuration Parsing Module",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed.",
			"reasoning": "Standard Go flag parsing and environment variable reading. Complexity is low, primarily involving precedence logic and path validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Skill Discovery Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed.",
			"reasoning": "Involves file system traversal (`filepath.WalkDir`) and conditional checks for specific files (`SKILL.md`). Handling edge cases like permissions and deduplication adds slight complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Conversion Command Builder and Executor",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) The Command Builder (pure function logic) and 2) The Executor (os/exec wrapper with output capturing).",
			"reasoning": "Requires careful handling of `os/exec` to ensure non-blocking execution (important for TUI), error capturing, and possibly context management for timeouts."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Basic TUI Model and List View",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into: 1) Model definition and state management, 2) List view rendering (using Lip Gloss), 3) Update loop logic for basic navigation.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up the initial Bubble Tea model correctly is crucial. Rendering a scrolling list with styling (Lip Gloss) and handling basic keyboard navigation requires coordination."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement TUI Conversion Interaction and Details Panel",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Async command triggering mechanism (`tea.Cmd`), 2) Message handling loop for status updates, 3) Details pane rendering logic.",
			"reasoning": "This introduces concurrency management within the TUI event loop. Handling async command results (`Msg`) and updating UI state dynamically increases complexity significantly."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create CLI Entrypoint and MVP Integration",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed.",
			"reasoning": "Wiring existing components. Main complexity is ensuring the TUI program starts correctly and exit codes are propagated."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Advanced TUI Actions (Override, Auto-Convert, Rescan)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate: 1) Batch processing logic for 'Auto-Convert' (generating multiple commands), 2) State reset logic for 'Rescan'.",
			"reasoning": "Auto-convert logic requires managing potentially many concurrent or queued operations, which can be tricky to implement cleanly in the TEA architecture without blocking the UI."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Gum Interoperability and Debug Logging",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed.",
			"reasoning": "Checking for an external binary (`gum`) and conditionally executing it is straightforward. Debug logging integration is largely cross-cutting but simple to implement."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Final Documentation, Polish, and Edge Case Testing",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed.",
			"reasoning": "Primarily non-code tasks or augmenting existing tests. Complexity is low, though time-consuming."
